Elijah's Printify Automation is a Windows application that automates the process of creating and publishing products on the Printify platform.

The first step is creating your base products. 
Your base products are the products that will be used to exract information from and bulk generate new products with different images.

Example of use: I create 3 base products (Tshirt, Hoodie, Bag) on Printify. I launch the Printify Automation application and enter my API key, select my shop, and select the 3 base products. Then I upload 500 images in the next step in the application. I press create products and the result will be 1500 products (500 Tshirts, 500 Hoodies, 500 Bags) will be created automatically with the option to publish all the newly created products to my Store (Shopify, and all others) in one click.

 Features

- Product Selection: Choose products to use as base products by selecting them from the product list window or entering comma-separated product IDs.
- Image Upload: Select and upload as many pictures as you want in one click.
- Custom Values: By default all values (X, Y, Scale, Angle) are extracted from each indiviual product and used to create the new products. If you wish you can input custom values and all products created will be created with those values.
